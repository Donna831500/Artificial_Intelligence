This project apply following algorithms to find optimal path.
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
- A* search (A*).
Please see more details in the instruction.pdf.

## Data
There are 50 test cases in 'testcases.zip' file. Please unzip the file and put all the input*.txt files
in the same directory with homework.py file before execution. After execution, there are 50 output*.txt files. The correctness could be check by compare the output files produced by code and the output files in the 'testcases.zip' file.

## Execution
To execute the code simply run:
```console
python homework.py
```
